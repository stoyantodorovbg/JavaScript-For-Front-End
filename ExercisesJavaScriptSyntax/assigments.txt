Problems for exercises and homework for the "JavaScript For Front-End Course @ SoftUni".

1.	Multiply a Number by 2
You are given a number N. Create a JS function that multiplies the number by 2 and prints the result. The input comes as an array of strings.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output		Input	Output		Input	Output
2	4		3	6		30	60		13	26
Hints
 
2.	Multiply Two Numbers
You are given a number X and a number Y. Create a JS function that multiplies X * Y and prints the result. The input comes as array of strings.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output		Input	Output		Input	Output
2
3	6		13
13	169		1
2	2		0
50	0
3.	Multiply / Divide a Number by a Given Second Number
You are given a number N and a number X. Create a JS function that:
•	Multiplies N * X if X is greater than or equal to N
•	Divides N / X if N is greater than X
The input comes as array of strings.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output		Input	Output		Input	Output
2
3	6		13
13	169		3
2	1.5		144
12	12
4.	Product of 3 Numbers
You are given a number X, Y and Z. Create a JS function that finds if X * Y * Z (the product) is negative or positive. Try to do this WITHOUT multiplying the 3 numbers.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output		Input	Output
2
3
-1	Negative		5
4
3	Positive		-3
-4
5	Positive
Hint
•	Count the negative numbers. If they are odd number, the result will be negative, otherwise ? positive.
•	Special case: one of the numbers is 0 ? the product is positive.
5.	Print Numbers from 1 to N
You are given a number N. Create a JS function that loops through all the numbers from 1 to N and prints them. N will always be positive.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output
5	1
2
3
4
5		2	1
2
6.	Print Numbers from N to 1
You are given a number N. Create a JS function that loops through all the numbers from N to 1 and prints them. N will always be positive.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output
5	5

7.	Print Numbers in Reversed Order
You will be given a few numbers as input. You need to print them in reversed order, each on a new line.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output		Input	Output
10
